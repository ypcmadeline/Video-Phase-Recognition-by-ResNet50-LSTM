# Video-Phase-Recognition-by-ResNet50-LSTM
A temporal neural network is implemented to recognize different phases in sugurical video. 

## Data
The Cholec80 dataset is used in this project. The videos are sampled at 100 fps. 

## Model
A model of ResNet50 + LSTM is used to process the images. <br />
